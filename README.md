# Welcome to MS Teams Clone!

## Introduction

Welcome to the Microsoft Teams clone project! This project is built with React JS and utilizes [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io) for chat functionality.

React JS is the primary programming language used for building the frontend of the application, while Chat Engine provides a set of APIs and UI Kit specifically designed for chat applications.

This project serves as an excellent example of learning React and creating a production-ready application.

## Features

- **Real-time Chat**: Engage in real-time chat with other users using the built-in chat functionality powered by Chat Engine.
- **User Authentication**: Securely authenticate users to access the chat features and ensure privacy and security.
- **Message Notifications**: Receive notifications for new messages and stay updated on conversations even when the app is minimized.
