# Welcome to MS Teams Clone!

## Introduction

Welcome to the Microsoft Teams clone project! This project is built with React JS and utilizes [Chat Engine](https://chatengine.io) for chat functionality.

React JS is the primary programming language used for building the frontend of the application, while Chat Engine provides a set of APIs and UI Kit specifically designed for chat applications.

This project serves as an excellent example of learning React and creating a production-ready application.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in the following areas:

- **React JS**: Enhanced my proficiency in React JS by building a complex frontend application.
- **Component-based Architecture**: Learned how to structure a React application using component-based architecture for better organization and scalability.
- **State Management**: Utilized React's state management techniques to manage the application's state and user interactions effectively.
- **API Integration**: Integrated Chat Engine's APIs to enable real-time chat functionality within the application.
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented responsive design principles to ensure the application is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Project Deployment**: Deployed the project to a hosting platform to make it accessible to users worldwide.
